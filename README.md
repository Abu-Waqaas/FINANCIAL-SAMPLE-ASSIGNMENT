###RECOMMENDATIONS
1.	The sales team needs to work on themselves to produce more sales and need to learn from the Organic team what they’ve been doing that enhances a lot of growth in their business 

2.	The company should look into getting some technology product, it might not been having in store as it shows that people are buying technology products than any other products.


3.	We should make sure we are making advertisement in ither regions also, so that we can have more uniform sales in our products.

4.	The company should work more on the sales because it shows that the sales made was not upto the initial target, that’s what makes the profit acquired lesser than expected.

5.	The quantity of product sold should be work on more .
